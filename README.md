## üìñ Introduction

### Background
The dataset, obtained from Kaggle, contains transactional records from a cafe. Each entry includes item name, quantity sold, unit price, total amount, payment type, location, and date of sale.

### Problem Statement
Cafe sales are volatile, making inventory control, pricing, and staffing difficult. The project addresses issues like:
- Perishable overstock/understock
- Identifying top-selling vs. underperforming items
- Understanding customer purchasing patterns
- Regional performance variations

**Key Research Questions:**
- How can we forecast weekly/monthly item-level sales?
- What products are frequently bought together?
- Which products are high, medium, or low performers?
- How does sales performance vary across locations?

### Objective
This study aims to support cafe operations through:
- Analysis of historical sales
- Forecasting future trends
- Identifying drivers of performance
- Evaluating model accuracy

### Significance of Project
The findings help:
- Reduce waste through better inventory planning
- Improve staffing and supply chain decisions
- Drive revenue through product recommendations
- Build data-driven tools for small cafes and F&B businesses

## üöÄ Approach

### Data Collection
- Sourced from Kaggle
- Includes sales details by item, location, and date

### Preprocessing and Data Cleaning
- Removed missing/inconsistent values
- Handled missing values with median/mode imputation
- Unified labels (e.g., "tea", "TEA" ‚Üí "TEA")
- Removed duplicates and outliers
- Transformed skewed variables (e.g., log1p on `Total Spent`)
- Extracted time-based features from date

### Methods of Analysis
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Time Series Forecasting
- K-Means Clustering
- Content-Based Recommendation System

### Tools Used
- Python 3.13
- Libraries: `pandas`, `NumPy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`
- MLxtend for Apriori Algorithm
- Jupyter Notebooks for development
- GitHub for version control

- Extracted time-based features like month, weekday, etc.

#### Train-Test Split & Model Selection
- Time-aware train-test split
- Models:
  - `Linear Regression`
  - `Random Forest Regressor`
- Best Model:
  - **Random Forest**
    - R¬≤ Score: **0.899**
    - MSE: **0.0358**

### üåç Sales Analysis by Region

#### Objective
To compare performance across different locations and support regional planning.

#### Methodology & Results

| Location   | Total Sales | Avg Quantity | Monthly Growth |
|------------|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| Takeaway   | 13,460.13   | 2.97         | **+26%**       |
| In-Store   | 5,818.34    | 2.98         | **‚àí12%**       |

- Takeaway channels are growing significantly.
- In-store traffic is declining.

### üßä Product Clustering Analysis

#### Methodology & Results
- Applied K-Means clustering based on:
  - Total Quantity Sold
  - Frequency of Purchase
  - Total Revenue
- Used Elbow Method to determine optimal K
- **Silhouette Score**: 0.35

| Cluster | Items                    | Avg Revenue | Category        |
|---------|--------------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1       | Juice                    | 4,335.89    | üèÜ Top Performer |
| 2       | Coffee, Cake, Sandwich   | ~2,369      | üéØ Mid Tier      |
| 0       | Tea, Cookie              | 1,549.18    | üö® Low Performer |

### üß† Product Recommendation System

#### Overview
Built a content-based recommendation system to suggest item pairs.

#### Methodology & Results
- Used user-item matrix
- Computed cosine similarity between items
- Alternatively tested Apriori for frequent pairs

#### Sample Recommendation
If a customer buys a **Sandwich**, recommend:
- `Coffee`
- `Cake`
- `Cookie`

#### Business Implications
- Promote bundled deals
- Personalized upselling
- Drive revenue through cross-selling
